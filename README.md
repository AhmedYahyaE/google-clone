# Google Homepage Clone

This is totally Responsive (mobile first) Google Homepage Clone design. Only HTML & CSS3 are used. No frameworks.

Only CSS3 Media Queries used for responsive design.

Used Google Favicon too.

Implemented the clone using both Flexbox and Display CSS properties in two separate folders/directories.

It's really close to the original Google! 😎😉👍

Enjoy!
