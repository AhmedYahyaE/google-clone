# Google Homepage Clone

This is totally Responsive (mobile first) Google Homepage Clone design. Only HTML & CSS3 are used. No frameworks.

Only CSS3 Media Queries used for responsive design.

Used Google Favicon too.

Implemented the clone using both Flexbox and Display CSS properties in two separate folders/directories.

Check the repository files for both:

1- [Using CSS Flexbox property.](<Using CSS Flexbox - vh - Favicon/index.html>)

2- [Using CSS display table property.](<Using CSS display table - Position - Favicon/index.html>)

It's really close to the original Google! 😎😉👍

Enjoy!
